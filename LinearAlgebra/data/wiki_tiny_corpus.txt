Linear algebra underpins embeddings and similarity search.
Projections help agents keep only task-relevant context.
SVD captures dominant topics for compression and summarization.
Eigenvectors enable ranking flows like PageRank for actions.
Least squares fits linear decision models for planners.
Quadratic forms encode safety or preference penalties for actions.
